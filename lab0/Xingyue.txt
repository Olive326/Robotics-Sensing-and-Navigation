I installed Ubuntu 24.04 using dual boot on my Win.
I downloaded the .iso file from the official ubuntu website and followed the instruction provided in the lab manual.
The installation was successful. Now I can boot into Ubuntu and start working.
The  major challenge I encountered was related to disk alllocation. 
Initially, I shrinked 100G from my D drive and 80 G from E drive to support the Ubuntu installation. 
However,during the setup, Ubuntu could only recognize one of the two unallocated spaces, and I couldn't merge or use both. 
Since the partition configuration couldn't be changed from the UBuntu installer, 
I rebooted into Windows, delted the E drive partition, and turned the entire E drive into unallocated space.
After that, Ubuntu successfully recognized the full 180GB, and everthing worked properly.

I installed Git on my Ubuntu system by running the command:
sudo apt-install git
I verified it with:
git --version
git version 2.43.0
